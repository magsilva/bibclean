** The value of MAX_TOKEN was originally 4093, but that proved too

**
** A scan of more than 600,000 entries in the TeX User Group and
** BibNet Project archives found that the longest complete BibTeX
** entry was less than 24,500 characters, so a 32KB limit, less a bit
** of overhead, should be ample for future growth.
**
** Modern BibTeX implementations (2007 and later) have larger tables,
** and dynamic array resizing, so the old arbitrary limits on string
** sizes really do need to be relaxed, and reset to reasonable values
** based on real experience.
