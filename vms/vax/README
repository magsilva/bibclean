bibclean has been successfully built and tested on DEC VAX VMS 6.1
with the DEC C V4.0-000 compiler.  The associated files are provided
in the vms/vax subdirectory.  To install it on your system, copy the
bibclean.exe and top-level bibclean.ini files to a suitable location,
create a foreign command symbol to point to it, and then use it as
documented in the UNIX manual pages.  UNIX/DOS style command-line
redirection of standard input and standard output, and command-line
file wild-carding, are supported.

The executable program has been linked with static libraries, so that
it should be usable on other versions of VMS as well as 6.1.  In the
event that it is not, you can rebuild it from the *.obj files included
in the distribution, even if you don't have a license for the C
compiler, just by executing the LINK command at the end of the
vmsbuild.com file.

To recompile and link bibclean on your VAX VMS system:

	$ @vmsmake

To run the validation suite, edit the vmstest.com file to change the
foreign command symbol definition near the beginning from

$ bibclean :== $public$disk:[nbeebe.bibclean]bibclean.exe

to something appropriate for your system, then execute the file:

	$ @vmstest

You will need all of the test*.* files, and the bibclean.ini file,
from the top level directory in the bibclean distribution to do this.
