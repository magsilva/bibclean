% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>

% This file stress-tests bibclean and biblex by
% presenting them with input that has spaces
% liberally sprinkled throughout, especially
% between tokens.  It is designed as a useful test
% of a proposed grammar for BibTeX.

%=================================================
% Test 1: simple case without extra spaces

@preamble{"anythinggoes"}

@include{a-file-name-goes-here}

@string{abb="abbreviation"}

@Article{the-key,
author="A. U. Thor",
title="The Title",
journal="The Journal",
year="1993",
volume="23",
number="1",
pages="17--21",
month=jan,
bibdate="Mon Jan 18 09:59:44 1993",
}

%=================================================
% Test 2: simple one-line cases with intervening
% spaces

 @ preamble { "anything goes" }

 @ include { a-file-name-goes-here }

 @ string { abb = "abbreviation" }
