                 Ins(1,3,4,5)P${}_4$. These were injected through a
                 double barrel electrode and the {\Cl} current was then
                 used to measure the {\Ca{}} response. ``The naturally
                 occurring {\IP{3}} produced a large initial transient
                 followed by a single transient or burst of
                 oscillations. By contrast, two analogues ({\IP{3}} and
                 Ins(2,4,5)P${}_3$) produced different oscillatory
                 pattern made up of a short burst of shape transients.
                 $\cdots$ Both analogues failed to induce a response
                 when injected after the initial {\IP{3}}-induced
                 response, indicating that they act on the same
                 intracellular pool of \Ca{} [not necessarily the case].
                 The existence of different oscillatory patterns
                 suggests that there may be different mechanisms for
                 setting up \Ca{} oscillations. The {\IP{3}} and
                 Ins(2,4,5)P${}_3$ analogues may initiate oscillations
                 through a negative feedback mechanism whereby \Ca{}
                 inhibits its own release. The two-pool model is most
                 likely mechanism to describe the {\IP{3}}-induced
                 oscillations.''",
