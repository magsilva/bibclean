Command-line switches may be abbreviated to a unique leading
prefix, and letter case is not significant.  All options are parsed
before any input bibliography files are read, no matter what their
order on the command line.  Options that correspond to a yes/no
setting of a flag have a form with a prefix "no-" to set the flag
to no.  For such options, the last setting determines the flag
value used.  That is significant when options are also specified in
initialization files (see the INITIALIZATION FILES manual section).

The leading hyphen that distinguishes an option from a filename may
be doubled, for compatibility with GNU and POSIX conventions.
Thus, -author and --author are equivalent.

To avoid confusion with options, if a filename begins with a
hyphen, it must be disguised by a leading absolute or relative
directory path, e.g., /tmp/-foo.bib or ./-foo.bib.

-author   Display an author credit on the standard error unit,
          stderr, and then terminate with a success return code.
          Sometimes an executable program is separated from its
          documentation and source code; this option provides a way
          to recover from that.

-copyleft Display copyright information on the standard error unit,
          stderr, and then terminate with a success return code.

-copyright
          Display copyright information on the standard error unit,
          stderr, and then terminate with a success return code.

-error-log filename
          Redirect stderr to the indicated file, which will then
          contain all of the error and warning messages.  This
          option is provided for those systems that have difficulty
          redirecting stderr.

-help or -?
          Display a help message on stderr, giving a usage
          description, similar to this section of the manual pages,
          and then terminate with a success return code.

-ISBN-file filename
          Provide an explicit ISBN-range initialization file.  It
          will be processed after any system-wide and job-wide ISBN
          initialization files found on the PATH (for VAX VMS,
          SYS$SYSTEM) and BIBINPUTS search paths, respectively, and
          may override them.  The ISBN initialization file name can
          be changed at compile time, or at run time through a
          setting of the environment variable BIBCLEANISBN, but
          defaults to .bibclean.isbn on UNIX, and bibclean.isb
          elsewhere.  For further details, see the ISBN
          INITIALIZATION FILES manual section.

-init-file filename
          Provide an explicit value pattern initialization file.
          It will be processed after any system-wide and job-wide
          initialization files found on the PATH (for VAX VMS,
          SYS$SYSTEM) and BIBINPUTS search paths, respectively, and
          may override them.  It in turn may be overridden by a
          subsequent file-specific initialization file.  The
          initialization file name can be changed at compile time,
          or at run time through a setting of the environment
          variable BIBCLEANINI, but defaults to .bibcleanrc on
          UNIX, and to bibclean.ini elsewhere.  For further
          details, see the INITIALIZATION FILES manual section.

-keyword-file filename
          Provide an explicit keyword initialization file.  It will
          be processed after any system-wide and job-wide keyword
          initialization files found on the PATH (for VAX VMS,
          SYS$SYSTEM) and BIBINPUTS search paths, respectively, and
          may override them.  The keyword initialization file name
          can be changed at compile time, or at run time through a
          setting of the environment variable BIBCLEANKEY, but
          defaults to .bibclean.key on UNIX, and bibclean.key
          elsewhere.  For further details, see the KEYWORD
          INITIALIZATION FILES manual section.

-max-width nnn
          bibclean normally limits output line widths to 72
          characters, and in the interests of consistency, that
          value should not be changed.  Occasionally, special-
          purpose applications may require different maximum line
          widths, so this option provides that capability.  The
          number following the option name can be specified in
          decimal, octal (starting with 0), or hexadecimal
          (starting with 0x).  A zero or negative value is
          interpreted to mean unlimited, so -max-width 0 can be
          used to ensure that each field/value pair appears on a
          single line.

          When -no-prettyprint requests bibclean to act as a
          lexical analyzer, the default line width is unlimited,
          unless overridden by this option.

          When bibclean is prettyprinting, line wrapping will be
          done only at a space. Consequently, a long non-blank
          character sequence may result in the output exceeding the
          requested line width.

          When bibclean is lexing, line wrapping is done by
          inserting a backslash-newline pair when the specified
          maximum is reached, so no line length will ever exceed
          the maximum.

-[no-]align-equals
          With the positive form, align the equals sign in
          key/value assignments at the same column, separated by a
          single space from the value string.  Otherwise, the
          equals sign follows the key, separated by a single space.
          Default: no.

-[no-]brace-protect
          Protect uppercase and mixedcase words at brace-level zero
          with braces to prevent downcasing by some BibTeX styles.
          Default: yes.

-[no-]check-values
          With the positive form, apply heuristic pattern matching
          to field values in order to detect possible errors (e.g.,
          ``year = "192"'' instead of ``year = "1992"''), and issue
          warnings when unexpected patterns are found.

          That checking is usually beneficial, but if it produces
          too many bogus warnings for a particular bibliography
          file, you can disable it with the negative form of this
          option.  Default: yes.

-[no-]debug-match-failures
          With the positive form, print out a warning when a value
          pattern fails to match a value string.

          That is helpful in debugging new patterns, but because
          the output can be voluminous, you should use this option
          only with small test files, and initialization files that
          eliminate all patterns apart from the ones that you are
          testing.  Default: no.

-[no-]delete-empty-values
          With the positive form, remove all field/value pairs for
          which the value is an empty string.  That is helpful in
          cleaning up bibliographies generated from text editor
          templates. Compare this option with -[no-]remove-OPT-
          prefixes described below.  Default: no.

-[no-]file-position
          With the positive form, give detailed file position
          information in warning and error messages.  Default: no.

-[no-]fix-accents
          With the positive form, normalize TeX accents in annotes,
          authors, booktitles, editors, notes, remarks, and titles.
          Default: no.

-[no-]fix-braces
          With the positive form, normalize bracing in annotes,
          authors, booktitles, editors, notes, remarks, and titles,
          by removing unnecessary levels of braces.  Default: no.

-[no-]fix-font-changes
          With the positive form, supply an additional brace level
          around font changes in titles to protect against
          downcasing by some BibTeX styles.  Font changes that
          already have more than one level of braces are not
          modified.

          For example, if a title contains the Latin phrase {\em
          Dictyostelium Discoideum} or {\em {D}ictyostelium
          {D}iscoideum}, then downcasing will incorrectly convert
          the phrase to lower-case letters.  Most BibTeX users are
          surprised that bracing the initial letters does not
          prevent the downcase action.  The correct coding is {{\em
          Dictyostelium Discoideum}}.  However, there are also
          legitimate cases where an extra level of bracing wrongly
          protects from downcasing.  Consequently, bibclean will
          normally not supply an extra level of braces, but if you
          have a bibliography where the extra braces are routinely
          missing, you can use this option to supply them.

          If you think that you need this option, it is strongly
          recommended that you apply bibclean to your bibliography
          file with and without -fix-font-changes, then compare the
          two output files to ensure that extra braces are not
          being supplied in titles where they should not be
          present.  You will have to decide which of the two output
          files is the better choice, then repair the incorrect
          title bracing by hand.

          Because font changes in titles are uncommon, except for
          cases of the type which this option is designed to
          correct, it should do more good than harm.  Default: no.

-[no-]fix-initials
          With the positive form, insert a space after a period
          following author initials.  Default: yes.

-[no-]fix-math
          With the positive form, improve readability of math mode
          in titles by inserting spaces around operators, deleting
          other unnecessary space, and removing braces around
          single-character subscripts and superscripts.  Default:
          no.

-[no-]fix-names
          With the positive form, reorder author and editor name
          lists to remove commas at brace level zero, placing first
          names or initials before last names.  Default: yes.

-[no-]German-style
          With the positive form, interpret quote characters ["]
          inside braced value strings at brace level 1 according to
          the conventions of the TeX style file german.sty, which
          overloads quote to simplify input and representation of
          German umlaut accents, sharp-s (es-zet), ligature
          separators, invisible hyphens, raised/lowered quotes,
          French guillemets, and discretionary hyphens.  Recognized
          character combinations will be braced to prevent BibTeX
          from interpreting the quote as a string delimiter.

          Quoted strings receive no special handling from this
          option, and because German nouns in titles must anyway be
          protected from the downcasing operation of most BibTeX
          bibliography styles, German value strings that use the
          overloaded quote character can always be entered in the
          form "{...}", without the need to specify this option at
          all.

          Default: no.

-[no-]keep-linebreaks
          Normally, line breaks inside value strings are collapsed
          into a single space, so that long value strings can later
          be broken to provide lines of reasonable length.

          With the positive form, linebreaks are preserved in value
          strings.  If -max-width is set to zero, this preserves
          the original line breaks.  Spacing outside value strings
          remains under bibclean's control, and is not affected by
          this option.

          Default: no.

-[no-]keep-parbreaks
          With the positive form, preserve paragraph breaks (either
          formfeeds, or lines containing only spaces) in value
          strings.  Normally, paragraph breaks are collapsed into a
          single space.  Spacing outside value strings remains
          under bibclean's control, and is not affected by this
          option.  Default: no.

-[no-]keep-preamble-spaces
          With the positive form, preserve all whitespace in
          @Preamble{...} entries.  Default: no.

-[no-]keep-spaces
          With the positive form, preserve all spaces in value
          strings.  Normally, multiple spaces are collapsed into a
          single space.  This option can be used together with
          -keep-linebreaks, -keep-parbreaks, and -max-width 0 to
          preserve the form of value strings while still providing
          syntax and value checking.  Spacing outside value strings
          remains under bibclean's control, and is not affected by
          this option.  Default: no.

-[no-]keep-string-spaces
          With the positive form, preserve all whitespace in
          @String{...} entries.  Default: no.

-[no-]parbreaks
          With the negative form, a paragraph break (either a
          formfeed, or a line containing only spaces) is not
          permitted in value strings, or between field/value pairs.
          That may be useful to quickly trap runaway strings
          arising from mismatched delimiters.  Default: yes.

-[no-]prettyprint
          Normally, bibclean functions as a prettyprinter.
          However, with the negative form of this option, it acts
          as a lexical analyzer instead, producing a stream of
          lexical tokens.  See the LEXICAL ANALYSIS manual section
          for further details.  Default: yes.

-[no-]print-ISBN-table
          With the positive form, print the ISBN-range table on
          stderr, then terminate with a success return code.

          That action is taken after all command-line options are
          processed, and before any input files are read (other
          than those which are values of command-line options).

          The format of the output ISBN-range table is acceptable
          for input as an ISBN initialization file (see the ISBN
          INITIALIZATION FILES manual section).  Default: no.

-[no-]print-keyword-table
          With the positive form, print the keyword initialization
          table on stderr, then terminate with a success return
          code.

          That action is taken after all command-line options are
          processed, and before any input files are read (other
          than those which are values of command-line options).

          The format of the output table is acceptable for input as
          a keyword initialization file (see the KEYWORD
          INITIALIZATION FILES manual section).  Default: no.

-[no-]print-patterns
          With the positive form, print the value patterns read
          from initialization files as they are added to internal
          tables.  Use this option to check newly-added patterns,
          or to see what patterns are being used.

          When bibclean is compiled with native pattern-matching
          code (the default), these patterns are the ones that will
          be used in checking value strings for valid syntax, and
          all of them are specified in initialization files, rather
          than hard-coded into the program.  For further details,
          see the INITIALIZATION FILES manual section.  Default:
          no.

-[no-]quiet
          This option is the opposite of -[no-]warning; it exists
          for user convenience, and for compatibility with other
          programs that use -q  for quiet operation, without
          warning messages.

-[no-]read-init-files
          With the negative form, suppress loading of system-,
          user-, and file-specific initialization files.
          Initializations will come only from those files
          explicitly given by -init-file filename options.
          Default: yes.

-[no-]remove-OPT-prefixes
          With the positive form, remove the ``OPT'' prefix from
          each field name where the corresponding value is not an
          empty string.  The prefix ``OPT'' must be entirely in
          upper-case to be recognized.

          This option is for bibliographies generated with the help
          of the GNU Emacs BibTeX editing support, which generates
          templates with optional fields identified by the ``OPT''
          prefix.  Although the function M-x bibtex-remove-OPT
          normally bound to the keystrokes C-c C-o does the job,
          users often forget, with the result that BibTeX does not
          recognize the field name, and ignores the value string.
          Compare this option with -[no-]delete-empty-values
          described above.  Default: no.

-[no-]scribe
          With the positive form, accept input syntax conforming to
          the Scribe document system.  The output will be converted
          to conform to BibTeX syntax.  See the SCRIBE BIBLIOGRAPHY
          FORMAT manual section for further details.  Default: no.

-[no-]trace-file-opening
          With the positive form, record in the error log file the
          names of all files which bibclean attempts to open.  Use
          this option to identify where initialization files are
          located.  Default: no.

-[no-]warnings
          With the positive form, allow all warning messages.  The
          negative form is not recommended because it may mask
          problems that should be repaired.  Default: yes.

-output-file filename
          Supply an alternate output file to replace stdout.  If
          the filename cannot be opened for output, execution
          terminates immediately with a nonzero exit code.

-version  Display the program version number on stderr, and then
          terminate with a success return code.  That will also
          include an indication of who compiled the program, the
          host name on which it was compiled, the time of
          compilation, and the type of string-value matching code
          selected, when that information is available to the
          compiler.
