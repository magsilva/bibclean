% This file stress-tests bibclean and biblex by
% presenting them with input that has spaces
% liberally sprinkled throughout, especially
% between tokens.  It is designed as a useful test
% of a proposed grammar for BibTeX.

%=================================================
% Test 1: simple case without extra spaces

@Preamble{"anythinggoes"}

@Include{a-file-name-goes-here}

@String{abb =    "abbreviation"}

@Article{the-key,
  author =       "A. U. Thor",
  title =        "The Title",
  journal =      "The Journal",
  year =         "1993",
  volume =       "23",
  number =       "1",
  pages =        "17--21",
  month =        jan,
  bibdate =      "Mon Jan 18 09:59:44 1993",
}

%=================================================
% Test 2: simple one-line cases with intervening
% spaces

  month =        jan,

%=================================================
