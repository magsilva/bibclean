		By contrast, two analogues ({\IP{3}} and

		$\cdots$ Both analogues failed to induce a response when
		injected after the initial {\IP{3}}-induced response,
		indicating that they act on the same intracellular pool
		of \Ca{} [not necessarily the case]. The existence of
		different oscillatory patterns suggests that there may
		be different mechanisms for setting up \Ca{}
		oscillations. The {\IP{3}} and Ins(2,4,5)P${}_3$

		feedback mechanism whereby \Ca{} inhibits its own
