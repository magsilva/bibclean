@Comment< 
This file contains a sample set of bibliography data base entries in
Scribe format.  It is used for testing the -scribe option of bibclean.

The first entry uses each of the 7 delimiters, each of the 3
separators, undelimited values, and embedded quotes to illustrate the
flexibility of Scribe syntax.  Note, however, that nested delimiters
are NOT permitted by Scribe; BibTeX permits nested braces and braced
quotes.
